## About The Project
In this project, we've honed our ability to engage in systems thinking before diving into the solution phase. Recognizing that effective problem-solving requires a comprehensive understanding of the system at play, we've adopted a multi-faceted approach. Our process entails meticulously defining the problem, conducting a thorough analysis using tools such as the 9-box method, and subsequently crafting a clear mission statement and use case scenarios. From there, we delve into identifying the needs and requirements, culminating in the development of a robust system architecture. This systematic approach ensures that our solutions are not only effective but also aligned with the intricacies of the broader system. We're working on a Smart Bus System to improve communication in transportation. We're using systems thinking to tackle the project's challenges. This means looking at the big picture to come up with solutions that fit well with what's already there and solve important problems.
